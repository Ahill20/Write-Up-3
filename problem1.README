# Problem 1: Searching an Array

One of the most common problems in programming is to search an array for a particular value.

For problem 1, you are given a fixed array of unique integers, called data, and you read in a single integer to search for.

If the value that you read is contained in the array, then output the index of it in the array. If it is not contained in the array, then output -1.
